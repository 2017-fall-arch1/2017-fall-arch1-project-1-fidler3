  The code reads from a text tile names "names.txt" then insert them into a Binary Search Tree data structure. Then it will prompt you to make 
  additions to the list. Enter names you want to be added to the tree, and enter a null for it to continue. It will then print the additions made
  to the list. Then you will be prompted to enter names you want to delete, enter null to continue, and a updated list and file will be made.
